= DEPRECATED =

[WARNING]
====
The deployer is being deprecated and the new recommended approach is to use Ansible for the metrics installation.

Please see the link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/cluster_metrics.html[OpenShift Metrics installation instructions]

= Installing Origin Metrics using the Deployer Pod

[NOTE]
====
In order to support the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA), all of the metric components will need to be deployed to the `openshift-infra` project.
====

=== Deployer Service Account

A pod is used to setup, configure and deploy all the various metric components. This deployer pod is run under the `metrics-deployer` service account.

The `metrics-deployer` service account can be created from the link:metrics-deployer-setup.yaml[*_metrics-deployer-setup.yaml_*] configuration file. The following command will create the service account for you:

----
$ oc create -f metrics-deployer-setup.yaml -n openshift-infra
----

In order to deploy components within the project, the `metrics-deployer` service account needs to be granted the 'edit' permission.

This can be accomplished by running the following command:

----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user edit \
        system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer \
        -n openshift-infra
----

=== Hawkular Service Account

The hawkular service account requires `view` permissions in order to gather information about the pods that will make up a Hawkular Metrics cluster.

Run the following command to add the `view` permission to the `hawkular` service account:

----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user view \
        system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:hawkular \
        -n openshift-infra
----


=== Heapster Service Account

The heapster component requires accessing the kubernetes node to find all the available nodes as well as accessing the `/stats` endpoint on each of those nodes. This means that the `heapster` service account which requires having the `cluster-reader` permission.

The following command will give the `heapster` service account the required permission:

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \
        system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster \
        -n openshift-infra
----

=== Create the Metrics Deployer Secret

The *metrics deployer* auto-generates self-signed certificates for
use internally between components.

Since *Hawkular Metrics* needs to be accessed outside of the internal network in the OpenShift Console, it will create
a re-encrypting route for this purpose. By default this will use the router's certificate for the SSL connections, but you can provide your
own certificate as a secret for the deployer which will allow you to use your own certificates in this re-encrypting route.

To provide your own certificates, you can pass these
values as secrets to the *metrics deployer*.

For instance, to optionally provide your own certificates for Hawkular Metrics, you can point your secret to the certificate's *_.pem_* (which has to include the private key) and certificate authority file:

----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert -n openshift-infra
----

If you do not wish to provie your own certificates and use the router's certificates instead, you will just need to generate an empty secret:

----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null -n openshift-infra
----

For a full listing of all the available secrets for the Origin Metrics deployer, please see the link:docs/deployer_configuration.adoc#deployer-secrets[deployer configuration] page.

=== Deploying Only Heapster

If you do not wish to deploy the Hawkular Metrics and Cassandra containers, it is possible to just deploy the Heapster components in a stand alone manner.

If you do wish to deploy all the metrics components and have access to metric graphs in the OpenShift console, please continue to the link:#deploying-all-of-the-metrics-components[Deploying all of the Metrics Components] section.

[WARNING]
====
The OpenShift console uses Hawkular Metrics for its graphing capabilities. If you only deploy Heapster you will not be able to view any metrics in the console.
====

The Heapster deployer template does not have an required parameters and will fallback to defaults. For a full list of parameters options please see the link:docs/deployer_configuration.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[deployer configuration] page.

You should only run the following command if you are sure that you only want the Heapster component to be deployed:

----
$ oc process -f metrics-heapster.yaml | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

=== Deploying all of the Metrics Components

==== Persistent Storage

You can deploy the metrics components with or without persistent storage.

Running with persistent storage means that your metrics will be stored to a link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent volume] and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This requires an admin to have setup and made available a persistent volume of sufficient size. Running with persistent storage is highly recommended if you require metric data to be guarded against data loss. Please see the link:docs/persistent_storage.adoc[persistent storage] page for more information.

Running with non-persistent storage means that any stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted or restarted. Metrics will still survive a container being restarted. It is much easier to run with non-persistent data, but with the tradeoff of potentially losing this metric data. Running with non-persistent data should only be done when data loss under certain situations is acceptable.


[IMPORTANT]
====
When using persistent storage you will need to make sure that your storage size is appropriate for your needs. The Cassandra database can and will use up all the available space allocated to the Persistent Volume which will cause serious errors.

Metric data expires based on the *METRIC_DURATION* template parameter. Normally this means that older data is being removed at about the same pace as newer data arrives. You will still need to monitor your data usage to make sure that changes to your cluster have not caused your usage to increase beyond what your persistent volume will be able to handle.
====


==== Deployer Template

To deploy the metric components, you will need to deploy the 'metrics' template.

The only required template parameter is `HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME`. This parameter specifies the hostname that hawkular metrics is going to be hosted under. This is used to generate the Hawkular Metrics certificate and is used for the host in the route configuration.

For the full list of deployer template options, please see the link:docs/deployer_configuration.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[deployer configuration] page.

[NOTE]
====
The following options assume that the kubernetes master will be available under `https://kubernetes.default.svc:443` if this is not the case please set the link:docs/deployer_configuration.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[MASTER_URL]. Failure to properly set this may result in strange i/o timeout errors in the deployer logs.
====

If you are using non-persistent data, the following command will deploy the metric components without requiring a persistent volume to be created before hand:

----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml \
       -v HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
       -v USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
     | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

If you are using persistent data, the following command will deploy the metric components but requires a storage volume of sufficient size to be available:

----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml \
     -v HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
     -v USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=true \
     | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

(IMPORTANT!!!) If you use OpenShift version 3.9 or later you additionaly need to deploy an extra configmap for correct using of deployer.

----
oc create -f metrics-configmap.yaml -n openshift-infra
----

[NOTE]
====
If you ever wish to undeploy and then redeploy all the metric components, you can do so by setting the `MODE` template parameter to 'redeploy'. Note that this will also remove any persistent volume claims and any persisted data will be lost.
Any non persisted data will be lost as well. This is equivalent to deleting all the components and then restarting everything overagain.

For example:
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml \
     -v HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
     -v USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
     -v MODE=redeploy \
     | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

The `refresh` value for `MODE` performs the same steps as 'redeploy' but the persistent volume claims and route will not be deleted. Any non-persisted data will be lost with this operation. This option is useful if you wish
to redeploy your components with updated deployer secrets or if you wish to deploy another newer version.

For example:
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml \
     -v HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
     -v USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
     -v MODE=refresh \
     | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

To manually delete the pvc and route, you can run the following command:

----
$ oc delete pvc --selector="metrics-infra"
$ oc delete route --selector="metrics-infra"
----
====

== Verifying the Components after Installation

The first check should always be to see that the Hawkular Metrics, Cassandra, and Heapster pods are in the running state.

----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-infra
----

If all pods are in the running state, then you will want to check the Hawkular-Metrics status page:

----
$ curl -X GET https://${HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME}/hawkular/metrics/status
----

This will return a short json document. The important thing to look at here is the `MetricsService` value, if this is `STARTED` then it means that Hawkular Metrics has fully started and was able to successfully connect to Cassandra.

The next step will be to check the Heapster validate page. The link:#accessing-heapster-directly[Accessing Heapster Directly] section fully describes how to connect to this page. This page will show you some information about the current Heapster setup as well as how many metrics it knows about and has written into Hawkular Metrics.

Please see the link:docs/troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] if you are running into any issues.

== Configurations for the OpenShift Console

The OpenShift web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics service
to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics service
must be configured via the `*metricsPublicURL*` option in the *_master-config.yaml_*
file. This URL corresponds to the route created with the
`*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template parameter during the
link:#deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` corresponds to `hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the *_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
.master-config.yaml
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your OpenShift instance.

When your OpenShift server is back up and running, metrics will be displayed on
the pod overview pages.
